# Green-Energy---Power-BI
This project is a Power BI Dashboard that analyzes the feasibility of renewable energy adoption (Solar, Wind, Geothermal) across different building types. It provides insights into solar potential, payback period, carbon reduction, and optimal utilization to support sustainable energy decisions.

KPI Cards:

Average Solar Potential (kWh/m²/year)

Average Payback Period (Years)

Average Carbon Reduction (%)

Count of Building Types

Average Solar Utilization (%)

Solar Feasibility Analysis:

Scatter chart showing relationship between installation area (m²) and solar utilization (%), segmented by building type.

Energy Potential Comparison:

Bar chart comparing Solar, Wind, and Geothermal potential across different building types.

Filters / Slicers:

Building Type

Year Built

Insulation Level

 Dataset Details :

The dataset contains information about buildings and their renewable energy potential, including:

Building_Type (e.g., Brick Cottage, Stone Villa, Thatched Hut, Wooden House)

Year_Built

Floor_Area (m²) and Installation_Area (m²)

Solar_Potential (kWh/m²)

Wind_Potential (m/s)

Geothermal_Potential

Energy_Demand (kWh)

Carbon_Reduction (%)

Payback_Period (Years)

Optimal_Solar_Utilization (%)

Insights :

Larger installation areas generally lead to higher solar utilization.

Average payback period is ~8 years, indicating feasibility for long-term investment.

Carbon reduction potential averages 25%, showing significant environmental benefits.

Building type influences which renewable source (Solar/Wind/Geothermal) is most effective.

Tools Used :

Power BI Desktop – Data Visualization & Dashboard Design
